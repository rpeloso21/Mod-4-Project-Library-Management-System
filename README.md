# Library Management System

## About:
This is a library management system.  It is meant to help users interact with the books in the library, check books out of the library, and create and learn about authors and genres.

ON start up, the user will be prompted to input their user ID.  The default admin is '111'.  From here, any action taken will be done as the associated user.  There is an option to 'change user' once an additional user is created.

Each user is able to do several actions such as: 

Book interactions include:
- borrowing a book
- returning a book
- adding a new book

User interactions include:
- creating new users
- getting information on current users

There are also options to 'create new' and 'learn about' existing Genres and Authors
